<h1>Customer API Documentation</h1>
customer api - spring boot application. This api is built with Spring Boot, utilizing MySQL for data storage. It exposes endpoints to manage customer information, including id, first_name, last_name, email, and phone_number. The API is designed to be powerful, scalable, and easy to integrate into your applications.


## Note
        It's My First Springboot Back-end Project In which I have Implemented Rest API
        and also uses postman to test api:)

        üåü Thank you, me, for making it happen! Let's keep coding and building awesome things! üöÄ

        üöÄ Key Achievements:

        Developed a RESTful API that showcases my proficiency in Java and Spring Boot.
        Successfully handled the integration of MySQL, ensuring data persistence and reliability.
        Demonstrated a commitment to best practices, documentation, and a user-friendly API design.

## git clone https://github.com/yashtank86/customer-api-springboot.git

## Prerequisites
        Maven 3+.
        MySQL Workbench 8+.
        Postman v9+.

## Generate the Project
        Go to the website Spring Initializr to initialize the Spring Boot project. Add the following dependencies:
        Spring Boot DevTools: for the development tools.
        Lombok: to reduce boilerplate code (for example, getters and setters).
        Spring Web: to embed Apache Tomcat and include Spring MVC.
        Spring Data JPA: to facilitate the database layer.
        MySQL Driver: to enable communication between the Spring Boot application and the database.

## Navigate to the project directory:

## Configure the MySQL database connection in application.properties.
    spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:9090/customer-management-system
    spring.datasource.username = root
    spring.datasource.password = root
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

    server.error.include-stacktrace = never

    server.port = 8090
    
## mvn spring-boot:run
    The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8090/customer/save for POST method.
    http://localhost:8090/customer/retrieve/email=abc@gmail.com 
    := for GET method. Its uses emailId for retrieve the information from database

## Testing with Postman
        Test the application using Postman.
        Add a couple of customers.
        
        Enter the body of the request:
        
        {
            "first_name": "rahul",
            "last_name": "sharma",
            "email": "rs@gmail.com",
            "phoneNumber": "9515517878"
        }


## Select SEND, and rahul sharma will be saved into the database
